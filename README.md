# VFSControl
Control program for Velocity Flight Simulator.

Hello, I'm LinuxLover3000, aviation enthusiast and Roblox member since 2014. I am an alpha player for Velocity Flight Simulator. While trying to control airports, I noticed that it was very difficult to keep information organized. That's why I created VFSControl back in August of 2016. However I didn't get far. Earler in 2017, I rediscovered the old files and decided to build it back up again. I didn't quite finish it until October of 2017. Now, I've decided to release it and see how it goes. I hope you enjoy and I am open to constructive criticism.

Made with Windows Batch

Features:
Flight assistant
Air traffic control information organizer

Thanks,
Linux
